## imessage simulator
this project is "inspired" by an ad-ridden imessage generator i found online.

imessage simulator is a UI component that lets users superimpose text messages
inside imessage bubbles.

**demo**
![iMessage Simulator](https://github.com/ryanckulp/imessage_simulator/raw/master/assets/imessage-simulator-demo.gif "iMessage Simulator")

**how to help**

* dynamic times (top nav = now, response stamp = N from now)
* turn image urls into inline images
* make URLs clickable / styled with underlines, etc
* ability to open 'upload' modal if user clicks camera
* touch cursor to simulate mobile navigation
